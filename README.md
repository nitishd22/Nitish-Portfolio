Challenge #2 - Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## The Objective 

For this challenge, my goal was to create a web application from scratch. The application in question was a page for my personal portfolio. I used HTML and CSS to create this, using concepts such as flex boxes, variables, and more. I also included many small details such as transparent grid items when hovered over.

## The Finished Product
